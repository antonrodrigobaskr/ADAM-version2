## 4. Color Palette

Our color scheme is minimal, high-contrast, and focused.

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary** | **Royal Blue** | `#305CDE` | CTAs, Primary Buttons, Highlights, Links, Active States. |

## 5. Mobile & Responsive Design
As a telehealth platform, accessibility on mobile devices is critical.

### Breakpoints
- **Mobile**: < 768px (100% width containers, stacked layouts).
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1024px.
- **Desktop**: > 1024px.

### Mobile Optimization Rules
- **Touch Targets**: All interactive elements (buttons, links) must have a minimum touch area of **44x44px**.
- **Font Sizes**:
  - Body text should never be smaller than **16px** on mobile.
  - H1 headings should scale down to fit small screens (e.g., 32px-36px).
- **Spacing**: Use consistent spacing tokens (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px). Increase whitespace on mobile to improve touchability.
- **Navigation**: Use a hamburger menu or simplified bottom nav for mobile devices.

## 6. Voice & Tone
- **Professional**: Medical advice must sound authoritative and safe.
- **Discreet**: Respect user privacy in all messaging.
- **Approachable**: Avoid overly dense medical jargon; speak to the user as a helpful partner.
- **Direct**: especially for Call-to-Actions (e.g., "Consult a Doctor", "Get Started").
